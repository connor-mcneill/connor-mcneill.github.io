I taught 3 hybrid sections (40 students per section) of ST 311 - Introduction to Statistics in Autumn 2024 at NC State. It is our departmental survey course on statistical methods: collecting and summarizing data, sampling distributions, statistical inference, and linear regression. It is taught as both a general education course for non-majors and as a required course for a number of majors, including those majoring in Statistics.
