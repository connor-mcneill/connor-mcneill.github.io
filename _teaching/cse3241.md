I served as a grader/TA for CSE 3241 - Introduction to Database Systems. I graded for the course during Spring 2022, Autumn 2022, and Spring 2023. I graded for the online section of the class, which covers relational database concepts: entity-relationship diagrams, relational schema and algebra, normalization, coding in SQL, indexes, transactions, and non-relational databases.
