I was an Undergraduate Grader for CSE 2123 - Data Structures in Java taught by Prof. Zina Pichkar in Spring and Autumn 2021 semesters. I also assisted with grading during Spring 2022. The course is a large online course on data structures, recursion, and object-oriented programming for computer science minors and information systems majors.
