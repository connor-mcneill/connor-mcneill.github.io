This project was completed in Spring 2023 as part of an undergraduate/graduate level biostatistics course in Genomic Data Analysis. The goal of the project was to take a publicly-available raw dataset of human genomic data to obtain insights of a certain condition. I worked with a dataset of 88 samples and used four different statistical learning methods to find genes that could be used as good predictors of Bipolar Disorder and also show that we can utilize certain methods to predict whether a patient has Bipolar Disorder or not.
