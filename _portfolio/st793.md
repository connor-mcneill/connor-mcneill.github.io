This project was completed in Autumn 2024 as part of the Advanced Statistical Inference (ST 793) course at NC State, which is one of our core PhD courses. The goal of the project was to take a novel method proposed in a major journal within the last two years and then either use the paper for a simulation study or go over some theoretical proof(s) from the paper. I worked on this project with one of my colleagues in the department, and we decided to look at a simulation study based on the paper "A random projection approach to hypothesis tests in high-dimensional single-index models" (Liu and Huang, 2024) which was published in JASA Theory and Methods.

The code, paper, and slides can all be found [here](https://github.com/connor-mcneill/st793-project) on the Github repository for this project.
