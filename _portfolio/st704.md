This project was completed in Spring 2024 as part of a PhD-level course in statistical methods (ST 704) at NC State. I worked with two of my colleagues in my department on this project. The goal of the project was to take a publicly-available dataset, come up with a research question to study the data, and perform an appropriate data analysis using multiple different modeling techniques. We focused on early career pay of college students upon graduation and looked at what factors were important when predicting a student's salary.
