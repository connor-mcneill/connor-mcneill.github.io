This project was completed in Spring 2025 as part of our Statistical Computing core PhD course (ST 758) at NC State. I worked with two of my colleagues in my department on this project. The goal of the project was to take our assigned topic (uncertainty quantification for deep learning models using bootstrapping techniques) and both perform a literature review and conduct a simulation study. We looked at a variety of different techniques that utilized bootstrapping and then applied them to a toy problem that compared them.
