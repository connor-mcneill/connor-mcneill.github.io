title: "Class Project: Decision Making using Bayesian Modeling"
summary: "This project was completed in Spring 2022 as part of an undergraduate class at Ohio State. The goal of the project was to apply Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling to see if a cheaper but more ineffective test was good enough to utilize for medical treatment."

This project was completed in Spring 2022 as part of an undergraduate class research project for a class on Bayesian Analysis and Statistical Decision Making (STAT 3303) at Ohio State. The goal of the assignment was to analyze a small clinical 'toy dataset', with the goal being to look at a specific country in the dataset and determine whether the cheaper but ineffective test is good enough in terms of cost analysis. This project ended up being rather enjoyable to complete and was what led me to having an interest in Bayesian inference and way of thinking!

The project report can be found [here](https://connor-mcneill.com/files/Final%20Project%20Bayesian%20Analysis%20%26%20Statistical%20Decision%20Making%20Connor.pdf). Code utilized is in R and JAGS, located at the end of the paper file.
