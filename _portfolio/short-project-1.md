This project was completed in Spring 2022 as part of an undergraduate class research project for a class on Bayesian Analysis and Statistical Decision Making. The goal of the assignment was to analyze a small clinical 'toy dataset', with the goal being to look at a specific country in the dataset and determine whether the cheaper but ineffective test is good enough in terms of cost analysis.
