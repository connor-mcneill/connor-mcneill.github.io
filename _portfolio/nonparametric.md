This project was completed in Autumn 2025 as part of a PhD-level advanced special topics course in nonparametric regression. I worked with two of my colleagues in my department on this project. The goal of the project was to take our assigned topic (deep learning for multi-dimensional FDA) and both perform a literature review and conduct a simulation study. We looked at a variety of different techniques and then applied them to real and simulated data analyses.

The project code can be found on the [project's Github repository](https://github.com/halljc76/ST758_Final_Project), along with the [paper](https://github.com/halljc76/ST790_NP_FinalProject/blob/main/ST790_Nonparametric_Regression-Paper.pdf) and [slides](https://github.com/halljc76/ST790_NP_FinalProject/blob/main/ST790_Nonparametric_Regression.pdf)
