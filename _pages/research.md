Hi there, welcome to my research page. I am currently working on two projects under the direction of my advisor, Dr. Brian Reich. My research interests largely lay within applied statistics and methodology.
I am particularly interested in using Bayesian inference and spatial modeling for applications in medicine, epidemiology, and environmental health. I am quite interested in public health and
statistics for understanding it!
