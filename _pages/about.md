Hi there! I'm Connor McNeill, and I am a Statistics PhD Student at [North Carolina State University](http://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu). I received my B.S. with Honors from [The Ohio State University](http://stat.osu.edu), where I majored in Statistics and minored in Computer Science.

My research interests are in spatial modeling, Bayesian inference, and statistical epidemiology. Here at NC State, I am advised by [Dr. Brian Reich](https://bjreich.wordpress.ncsu.edu). I am a part of the [UQ4Life Research Training Group](https://uq4life.wordpress.ncsu.edu), which is an NSF funded program in training students in uncertainty quantification. I also am passionate about statistical education, especially at the undergraduate level. Most recently I have served as instructor of record for our [department's introductory survey course](https://wolfware.ncsu.edu/courses/details/?sis_id=SIS:2024:8:1:ST:311:303) in statistical methods.

Outside of my studies, I serve on the Advisory Board of [College Club Swimming](http://collegeclubswimming.com) as a regional championship liaison. I've enjoyed my time working with athletes and clubs across the country over the past two years and I am enjoying assisting regional championship hosts with organizing their meets this year.

My CV (last updated in December 2025) can be found [here](https://connor-mcneill.com/files/cv-Dec2025.pdf). My resume is also available upon request. I can be reached via email and you can find me at the platforms listed on this page.
