Hi there! I'm Connor McNeill, and I am a Statistics PhD Student at **[North Carolina State University](http://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu)**. I received my B.S. with Honors from **[The Ohio State University](http://stat.osu.edu)**, where I majored in Statistics and minored in Computer Science. I have enjoyed starting my graduate studies so far, and I look forward to continue to learn more about Statistics as I prepare to start research during this academic year.

My current research interests are currently quite broad, but largely lie within Bayesian methodology with public health and medical applications. I am apart of the UQ4Life Research Training Group, which is an NSF funded program in training students in uncertainty quantification. Currently, I am funded as a part of this program. I also am quite passionate about statistical education, specifically at the undergraduate level. Most recently I have taught our department's introductory survey course in statistical methods.

Outside of my studies, I serve on the Advisory Board of **[College Club Swimming](http://collegeclubswimming.com)** as a representative for the Central (Midwest) Region. I look forward to working with athletes across the country while being an advocate for fellow graduate students competing at the club level.

My CV (last updated in August 2024) can be found **[here](https://connor-mcneill.com/files/connor-cv_august2024.pdf)**. My resume is available upon request.
