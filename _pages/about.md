Hi, I'm Connor McNeill, and I am a Statistics PhD Student at [North Carolina State University]{statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu}. I received my B.S. with Honors from [The Ohio State University]{stat.osu.edu}, where I majored in Statistics and minored in Computer Science. I am looking forward to beginning my studies over the next year and learning a ton! 

Outside of the classroom, I serve on the Advisory Board of [College Club Swimming]{collegeclubswimming.com} which I was recently elected to for a two-year term. I look forward to working with athletes across the country while being an advocate for fellow graduate students competing at the club level.
