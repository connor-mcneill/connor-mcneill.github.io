Hi, I'm Connor McNeill, and I am a Statistics undergraduate at The Ohio State University. Welcome to my website, hosted on Github Pages! You can learn about my background on the [CV](http://connor-mcneill.github.io/cv/) page. For background on my experience teaching, you can visit the [Teaching](http://connor-mcneill.github.io/teaching/) page. The [Portfolio](http://connor-mcneill.github.io/portfolio/) page has some of my past projects and homework assignments that I have been particularly proud of throughout my time in academia. I'm currently in the process of preparing to apply for Statistics and Biostatistics PhD programs, with the goal of entering a graduate program in Fall 2023.
