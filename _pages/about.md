Hi there! I'm Connor McNeill, and I am a Statistics PhD Student at **[North Carolina State University](http://statistics.sciences.ncsu.edu)**. I received my B.S. with Honors from **[The Ohio State University](http://stat.osu.edu)**, where I majored in Statistics and minored in Computer Science. I am looking forward to beginning my graduate studies over the next year and learning more about the subject field.

Outside of my studies, I serve on the Advisory Board of **[College Club Swimming](http://collegeclubswimming.com)** of which I was recently elected to a two-year term. I look forward to working with athletes across the country while being an advocate for fellow graduate students competing at the club level.

My resume (last updated in August 2023) can be found **[here](https://connor-mcneill.com/files/ctm_resume_823.pdf)**.
