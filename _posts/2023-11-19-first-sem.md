Hello everyone! I've really enjoyed starting my studies this semester at NC State! This semester I am taking three courses: two required core first-year courses (statistical theory and methods) along with an elective course in clinical trial design and analysis. While the coursework has been demanding so far, I have been doing well in maintaining a healthy work-life balance along with being on top of my courses. The core classes are key in preparation for the qualifier exam next August, which is always on my mind, but right now I am mainly focused on learning the material as it will be helpful in future courses and research down the road. I also have enjoyed attending our weekly department seminars along with some of our department events like our ice cream socials and different holiday celebrations (all with delicious food of course). Looking forward to the rest of the semester and the year!
